# Bitnun Blockchain Ecosystem

Welcome to the Bitnun Blockchain Ecosystem project! This repository contains the complete implementation of a viral blockchain platform built from scratch, utilizing modern technologies and innovative approaches.

## Project Overview

The Bitnun project aims to create a decentralized, secure, and efficient blockchain ecosystem that leverages Rust for backend development, WebAssembly (WASM) for browser compatibility, and a React/Next.js frontend for a seamless user experience. The platform incorporates a unique AI-driven consensus mechanism and peer-to-peer (P2P) networking via WebSocket.

## Goals

- Develop a robust blockchain infrastructure that supports high transaction throughput and low latency.
- Implement an AI-driven consensus algorithm to enhance decision-making and adaptability.
- Create a user-friendly frontend application that provides real-time insights into the blockchain status and user interactions.
- Ensure a modular architecture that allows for easy updates and scalability.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust, WebSocket, WASM
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- **Networking**: P2P communication via WebSocket
- **Consensus**: AI-driven Proof-of-Action algorithm

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

- **backend**: Contains the Rust implementation of the blockchain, consensus algorithms, and P2P networking.
- **frontend**: Contains the React application for user interaction and visualization of blockchain data.
- **shared**: Contains shared TypeScript types and interfaces used across both the frontend and backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed for backend development.
- Node.js and npm installed for frontend development.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Run `cargo build` to compile the Rust project.
3. Run `cargo run` to start the backend server.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
